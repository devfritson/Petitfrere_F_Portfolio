            <div class="text-1-container">
                <p class="background-text">From the moment I graduated high school, I knew that I wanted to dive
                    straight into the workforce. I
                    started in the food industry, where I worked tirelessly for three years, starting off as a
                    dishwasher
                    and gradually working my way up to becoming a line cook. The experience I gained during this time
                    taught
                    me the importance of hard work and dedication.<br>

                    <br>But then, I knew it was time for a change. I transitioned into the world of armed and unarmed
                    security,
                    where every day brought a new challenge and an opportunity to learn. The thrill of never knowing
                    what
                    the day would bring kept me motivated and excited to come to work. <br>

                    <br>And then, just as I was settling into my new role, the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Suddenly,
                    everything
                    was uncertain, and I found myself reevaluating my priorities. It was then that I decided to take a
                    leap
                    and reinvent myself. <br>

                    <br>I delved into the world of wi-fi hacking and reconnaissance, armed with just a yagi antenna,
                    aircrack-ng, wireshark, and burpsuite. I was relentless in my pursuit of knowledge, constantly
                    deauthing
                    my devices, capturing the four-way handshake, and using dictionary attacks to crack passwords.
                    </br><br>But I
                    didn't stop there. I also immersed myself in Linux and Github, learning everything I could about
                    operating systems like Centos, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. I even got into bash shell scripting, eager
                    to
                    explore new ways to push my limits. <br>

                    <br>Through all of these experiences, I have learned that growth and progress require taking risks
                    and stepping outside of our comfort zones. And I am proud to say that my efforts have paid
                    off.</br><br>I am
                    now CompTIA A + and Security + certified, further demonstrating my commitment to excellence and my
                    dedication to mastering my craft.</br>

                    <br>I am excited to see what the future holds for me and to continue growing and learning every step
                    of
                    the way
